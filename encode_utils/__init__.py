#: The award property name that is common to all ENCODE Portal object profiles.

#: The aliases property name that is common to almost all ENCODE Portal object profiles.
#: Notably, the following profiles lack this property as of 2018-04-03:
#: ['access_key_admin', 'publication', 'award', 'organism', 'page', 'image', 'user', 'lab']

#: dict. Stores the lab property to the value of the environment variable `DCC_LAB` to serve as
#: the default lab when submitting an object to the Portal.

#: appear in the payload.

#: Most profiles have an 'alias' key, which stores a list of alias names that are
#: useful to the lab.  When POSTING objects to the Portal, these aliases must be prefixed
#: with the lab name and end with a colon, and this configuration variable stores that
#: prefix value.

#: appear in the payload, and the profile at hand isn't a member of the list
#: ``encode_utils.utils.Profile.AWARDLESS_PROFILES``.
