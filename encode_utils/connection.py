    For data submission or modification, and working with non-released datasets, you must have
    the environment variables `DCC_API_KEY` and `DCC_SECRET_KEY` set. Check with your DCC data wrangler
    if you haven't been assigned these keys.

    There are three log files opened in append mode in the directory specified by ``connection.LOG_DIR`` that
    are specific to whichever Portal you are connected to. When connected to Production, each log file
    name will include the token '_prod_'. For Development, the token will be '_dev_'. The three
    log files are named accordingly in reference to their purpose, and are classified as:

    1. debug log file - All messages sent to STDOUT are also written to this log file. In addition,
       all messages written to the error log file described below are logged here.
    2. error log file - Only terse error messages are sent to this log file for quick scanning of
       any potential issues. If you identify an error here that needs more explanation, then you
       should consult the debug log file.
    3. posted log file - Tabulates what was successfully POSTED. There are three tab-delimited
       colummns ordered as submission timestamp, record alias, and record accession (or UUID if
       the `accession` property doesn't exist for the profile of the record at hand). Note that if a
       record has several aliases, then only the first one in the list for the `aliases` property is
       used.

        Requires that you include in the payload the non-schematic key ``self.PROFILE_KEY`` to
        designate the name of the ENCODE object profile that you are submitting to, or the
        actual `@id` property itself.

        If the `lab` property isn't present in the payload, then the default will be set to the value
        of the `DCC_LAB` environment variable. Similarly, if the `award` property isn't present, then the
        default will be set to the value of the `DCC_AWARD` environment variable.

        Before the POST is attempted, any pre-POST hooks are fist called; see the method
        ``self.before_submit_hooks``).  After a successfuly POST, any after-POST submit hooks are
        also run; see the method ``self.after_submit_hooks``. 

        Args:
            payload: `dict`. The data to submit.
            require_aliases: `bool`.  `True` means that the 'aliases' property is to be required in
                 `payload`. This is the default and it is highly recommended not to change this
                 because it'll be easy to create duplicates on the server if accidentally POSTING
                 the same payload again.  For example, you can easily create the same biosample
                 as many times as you want on the Portal when not providing an alias.  Furthermore,
                 submitting labs should include at least one alias per record being submitted
                 to the Portal for traceabilty purposes in the submitting lab.
            upload_file: `bool`. If `False`, when POSTing files the file data will not
                be uploaded to S3, defaults to `True`. This can be useful if you have
                custom upload logic. If the files to upload are already on disk, it is
                recommmended to leave this with the default, which will use `aws s3 cp`
                to upload them.
            return_original_status_code: `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, then
                will return the original `requests.Response.status_code` of the initial
                post, in addition to the usual `dict` response.
            truncate_long_strings_in_payload_log: `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If
                `True`, then long strings (> 1000 characters) present in the payload
                will be truncated before being logged.

        Returns:
            `dict`: The JSON response from the POST operation, or the existing record if it already
            exists on the Portal (where a GET on any of it's aliases, when provided in the payload,
            finds the existing record). If `return_original_status_code=True`, then will
            return a `tuple` of the above `dict` and an `int` corresponding to the
            status code on POST of the initial payload.

        request.

        In general, this is a method combining ``remove_props`` and ``patch``.
        This is useful because some schema dependencies requires property
        removal and property patch (including adding new properties) happening
        at the same time. Please note that after the record is retrieved from
        the portal, ``props`` will be removed before the ``patch`` is applied.

        Args:
            props: `list`. The properties to remove from the record.
            patch: `dict`. containing the attribute key and value pairs to
                patch. Must contain the key ``self.ENCID_KEY`` in order to
                indicate which record to PATCH.
            raise_403: `bool`. `True` means to raise a
                ``requests.exceptions.HTTPError`` if a 403 status (forbidden)
                is returned. If set to `False` and there still is a 403 return
                status, then the object you were trying to PATCH will be
                fetched from the Portal in JSON format as this function's
                return value.
            extend_array_values: `bool`. Only affects keys with array values.
                `True` (default) means to extend the corresponding value on the
                Portal with what's specified in the payload. `False` means to
                replace the value on the Portal with what's in the payload.

        Returns:
            `dict`: The JSON response from the PUT operation, or an empty dict
                if the record doesn't exist on the Portal. Will also be an
                empty dict if the dry-run feature is enabled.

        Raises:
            requests.exceptions.HTTPError: if the return status is not ok

          3. Google Storage object (Not yet supported; see ticket at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues/535)

        For the AWS option above, the user must set the proper AWS keys, see the `wiki documentation`_.

              or a Google Storage object (i.e. gs://mybucket/test.txt).
              If not set, defaults to `None` in which case the local file path will be extracted from the

        """
        Searches the biosample_types for the given classification (i.e. tissue, cell line) and
        term_id or term_name. Both term_name and term_id need not be set - if both are than term_id
        will take precedence. The combination of classification and term_id/term_name uniquely 
        identifies a biosample_type. 

        Args:
            classification: `str`. A value for the 'classificaiton' property of the biosample_ontology
                profile.
            term_id: `str`. A value for the 'term_id' property of the biosample_ontology profile. 
            term_name: `str`. A value for the 'term_name' property of the biosample_ontology profile.

        Returns:
            `dict`. Empty if not biosample_type found, otherwise the JSON representation of the record.

        Raises:
            `RecordNotFound`: No search results. 
            `Exception`: More than one search result was returned. This should not happen and if 
                it does then it's likely a bug on the server side.
