"""
Given a tab-delimited or JSON input file containing one or more records belonging to one of the profiles
listed on the ENCODE Portal (such as https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/biosample.json),
either POSTS or PATCHES the records. The default is to POST each record; to PATCH instead, see
the ``--patch`` option.

When POSTING file records, the md5sum of each file will be calculated for you if you haven't
already provided the `md5sum` property. Then, after the POST operation completes, the actual file
will be uploaded to AWS S3. In order for this to work, you must set the `submitted_file_name`
property to the full, local path to your file to upload. Alternatively, you can set
`submitted_file_name` to and existing S3 object, i.e. s3://mybucket/reads.fastq.

Note that there is a special 'trick' defined in the ``encode_utils.connection.Connection()``
class that can be taken advantage of to simplify submission under certain profiles.
It concerns the `attachment` property in any profile that employs it, such as the `document`
profile.  The trick works as follows: instead of constructing the `attachment` propery object
value as defined in the schema, simply use a single-key object of the following format::

  {"path": "/path/to/myfile"}

and the `attachment` object will be constructed for you.

    ENCODE profile.
    When POSTING a record to a profile that includes the 'aliases' property, this package requires
    the 'aliases' property be used for traceability purposes and because without this property, 
    it'll be very easy to create duplicate objects on the Portal.  For example, you can easily 
    create the same biosample as many times as you want on the Portal when not providing an alias.""")

    The ID of the profile to submit to, i.e. use 'genetic_modification' for
    https://www.encodeproject.org/profiles/genetic_modification.json. The profile will be pulled down for
    type-checking in order to type-cast any values in the input file to the proper type (i.e. some
    values need to be submitted as integers, not strings).""")

    parser.add_argument("-i", "--infile", required=True, help="""
    The JSON input file or tab-delimited input file. 

    **The tab-delimited file format:**
    Must have a field-header line as the first line.
    Any lines after the header line that start with a '#' will be skipped, as well as any empty lines.
    The field names must be exactly equal to the corresponding property names in the corresponding 
    profile. Non-scematic fields are allowed as long as they begin with a '#'; they will be 
    skipped. If a property has an array data type (as indicated in the profile's documentation 
    on the Portal), the array literals '[' and ']' are optional. Values within the array must 
    be comma-delimited. For example, if a property takes an array of strings, then you can use 
    either of these as the value:

    1) str1,str2,str3
    2) [str1,str2,str3]

    On the other hand, if a property takes a JSON object as a value, then the value you enter must be
    valid JSON. This is true anytime you have to specify a JSON object.  Thus, if you are submitting a
    genetic_modification and you have two 'introduced_tags' to provide, you can supply them in either
    of the following two ways:

    1) {"name": "eGFP", "location": "C-terminal"},{"name": "FLAG","C-terminal"}
    2) [{"name": "eGFP", "location": "C-terminal"},{"name": "FLAG","C-terminal"}]

    **The JSON input file**
    Can be a single JSON object, or an array of JSON objects. Key names must match property names of
    an ENCODE record type (profile).

    **The following applies to either input file formats**
    When patching objects, you must specify the 'record_id' field to indicate the identifier of the record.
    Note that this a special field that is not present in the ENCODE schema, and doesn't use the '#'
    prefix to mark it as non-schematic. Here you can specify any valid record identifier
    (i.e. UUID, accession, alias).

    Some profiles (most) require specification of the 'award' and 'lab' attributes. These may be set
    as fields in the input file, or can be left out, in which case the default values for these
    attributes will be pulled from the environment variables DCC_AWARD and DCC_LAB, respectively.
    """)

    parser.add_argument("--patch", action="store_true", help="""
    Presence of this option indicates to PATCH an existing DCC record rather than register a new one.""")

    parser.add_argument("-w", "--overwrite-array-values", action="store_true", help="""
    Only has meaning in combination with the --patch option. When this is specified, it means that
    any keys with array values will be overwritten on the ENCODE Portal with the corresponding value
    to patch. The default action is to extend the array value with the patch value and then to remove
    any duplicates.""")
